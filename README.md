# Yahboom 4 channel infrared tracking sensor module
![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/Tracking-module/blob/master/TrackingModule.jpgr)

# Introduction
This tracking module adopts four tracking probes, and optimized spacing layout. The inner two probes can accurately identify the black line. The outer two probes can assist the inner probe to identify the black line and provide early warning. The car can recognize the 90Â°curved road and other difficult tracks. Knob-type adjustable resistors plus professional operational amplify circuits allow us to adjust the sensitivity of the sensor. You can use a cable or DuPont cable to connect it to a smart car or expansion board for various experiments. We have also reserved the hole for installing the copper columns and screws, you can expand it by yourself.
